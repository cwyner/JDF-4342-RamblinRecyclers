# Upcycle Build Overview
The Upcycle Build application aims to assist those who work in the reuse industry by managing their work all in one place. The app has 3 main functionalities:
1) An activity calendar for deconstruction workers
2) A receiving section for reuse center employees to manage their inventory
3) An upcycling section that tracks the amount of materials diverted from the waste stream to support funding efforts for reuse centers

Each of these parts makes up an app that provides a quality-of-life service to all of those working in this industry, enabling them to get work done with much more efficiency in a workplace that demands just as much.
